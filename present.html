        As of today, we live together in our happy home, married, with 2 chunky
        cats and I couldn't be happier. You became one of the most important
        person in my life. My best friend, my partner, my soul sausage. I can't
        thank you enough for having showed up in my life. Everday I consider
        mysel the luckiest person on this earth to have met someone like you.
        Someone with who I feel safe, respected, heard, loved, seen. I am home
        when I am with you. Home is wherever <strong> YOU</strong> are. I built
        this website to somehow explain to you that every moment we shared,
        every minute we spent together of every day, even at a distance, were
        and are, and will be, the happiest moments of my life. I can't imagine
        my life without you. The website isn't perfection, but I put my biggest
        effort into it, so I hope you like it. What matters the most to me, is
        that everyday that I wake up, everyday that I breath, everyday that I am
        on this earth, I get to share it with you, Leonardo Ehnimb. Thank you
        for giving me that. I am proud to call myself your wife. And I will be
        proud to do so for the rest of my days. I hope you let me love you, and
        let me be you companion, for the rest of your days. It would be my
        pleasure. Happy First Year Anniversary, love of my life.
